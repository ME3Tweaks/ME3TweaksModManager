    <list title="Commonly Asked Questions">
      <helpitem title="Does installation order matter" modaltitle="Installation Order" modalicon="INFO">For most DLC mods, installation order will not matter as the load order is controller by a file in the DLC named Mount.dlc. A few Mod Manager mods can automatically reconfigure based on what is installed, so you should typically install them at the end of your DLC mods. Texture mods should always be installed at the end. If you are installing ALOT, you should install that at the end, followed by the addon, and then other texture mods you want to use. Do not install other DLC or full-file replacement mods after installation or you will break the game.</helpitem>
      <!--<helpitem title="How to fix BIOGame directory" modaltitle="BIOGame Directory" modalicon="INFO">BIOGame is a folder in your Mass Effect 3 directory. It lets Mod Manager know where to install mods and source content, and as such is required for almost all functions to work. You can find it in your Origin Games/Mass Effect 3 folder. When selecting your game directory, search for the game executable, which is in Origin Games/Mass Effect 3/Binaries/win32.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mod Manager should detect where the game is installed by default. If it doesn't, you might have a broken installation of the game.</helpitem>-->
      <!--<helpitem title="Can I mix mods" modaltitle="Mixing Mods" modalicon="WARNING">Mods can be mixed through the Mod Manager mod merging utility in the tools menu. You can also overlay mods on top of each other in the game and then Run AutoTOC on game from the tools menu. Mods overlaid on top of each other may break each other or the game.</helpitem>-->
      <helpitem title="Can I get banned for using mods" modalicon="INFO" modaltitle="Mods and Multiplayer">Technically you can with Multiplayer mods. However BioWare has no active staff to do so and they haven't banned anyone since early 2013. That doesn't mean you should run mega-million, 1 hit kill, or masochist mods in public lobbies. If you must run mods that are likely to be unpleasant to others (such as ruining a legitimate MP career with mega million credits) please keep it in a private lobby.</helpitem>

Otherwise you will need to install Binkw32 bypass from the Tools menu.</helpitem>
      <helpitem title="Restored game files but a DLC is still not authorizing" modalicon="INFO" modaltitle="Custom DLC Auth Issues">If a mod you installed has Custom DLC, some options in Mod Manager do not remove them. If you attempted to restore your game but still get issues with authorizing a DLC you can go to Restore &gt; Remove All Custom DLC and it will delete any non-standard DLC folders. If this still doesn't work you may need to repair your game from Origin.</helpitem>

    <list title="Commonly Asked Questions">
      <helpitem title="Does installation order matter" modaltitle="Installation Order" modalicon="INFO">For most DLC mods, installation order will not matter as the load order is controller by a file in the DLC named Mount.dlc. A few Mod Manager mods can automatically reconfigure based on what is installed, so you should typically install them at the end of your DLC mods. Texture mods should always be installed at the end. If you are installing ALOT, you should install that at the end, followed by the addon, and then other texture mods you want to use. Do not install other DLC or full-file replacement mods after installation or you will break the game.</helpitem>

    <list title="Commonly Asked Questions">
      <helpitem title="Does installation order matter" modaltitle="Installation Order" modalicon="INFO">For most DLC mods, installation order will not matter as the load order is controller by a file in the DLC named Mount.dlc. A few Mod Manager mods can automatically reconfigure based on what is installed, so you should typically install them at the end of your DLC mods. Texture mods should always be installed at the end. If you are installing ALOT, you should install that at the end, followed by the addon, and then other texture mods you want to use. Do not install other DLC or full-file replacement mods after installation or you will break the game.</helpitem>
      <!--<helpitem title="How to fix BIOGame directory" modaltitle="BIOGame Directory" modalicon="INFO">BIOGame is a folder in your Mass Effect 3 directory. It lets Mod Manager know where to install mods and source content, and as such is required for almost all functions to work. You can find it in your Origin Games/Mass Effect 3 folder. When selecting your game directory, search for the game executable, which is in Origin Games/Mass Effect 3/Binaries/win32.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mod Manager should detect where the game is installed by default.

      <helpitem title="Can I get banned for using mods" modalicon="INFO" modaltitle="Mods and Multiplayer">Technically you can with Multiplayer mods. However BioWare has no active staff to do so and they haven't banned anyone since early 2013. That doesn't mean you should run mega-million, 1 hit kill, or masochist mods in public lobbies. If you must run mods that are likely to be unpleasant to others (such as ruining a legitimate MP career with mega million credits) please keep it in a private lobby.</helpitem>

However BioWare has no active staff to do so and they haven't banned anyone since early 2013. That doesn't mean you should run mega-million, 1 hit kill, or masochist mods in public lobbies. If you must run mods that are likely to be unpleasant to others (such as ruining a legitimate MP career with mega million credits) please keep it in a private lobby.</helpitem>

Otherwise you will need to install Binkw32 bypass from the Tools menu.</helpitem>
      <helpitem title="Restored game files but a DLC is still not authorizing" modalicon="INFO" modaltitle="Custom DLC Auth Issues">If a mod you installed has Custom DLC, some options in Mod Manager do not remove them. If you attempted to restore your game but still get issues with authorizing a DLC you can go to Restore &gt; Remove All Custom DLC and it will delete any non-standard DLC folders. If this still doesn't work you may need to repair your game from Origin.</helpitem>
